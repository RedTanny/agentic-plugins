# network-policy-architect Skill

**Audience:** Platform engineers and security architects responsible for Kubernetes network segmentation.

**Goal:** Design NetworkPolicies that enforce the principle of least privilege at the network layer — every connection must be explicitly justified and authorized.

This skill follows **NIST SP 800-207 (Zero Trust Architecture)** which states:

> *"Zero trust assumes there is no implicit trust granted to assets or user accounts based solely on their physical or network location."*

Recommendations carry the weight of a security audit. Every rule proposed must be justified. Every port opened must be documented. Every exception must be explicitly acknowledged by the user.

**MCP-First Approach**: This skill uses MCP tools from `openshift-administration` server. MCP tools have **absolute priority**.

**CLI Tools Policy**:
- **ALWAYS use MCP tools** when available
- **Last resort only**: CLI commands (`oc`, `kubectl`) may be attempted if no MCP alternative exists
- **Assume unavailable**: CLI tools are likely not installed in the execution environment

## Prerequisites

**Required MCP Servers:** `openshift-administration` — Kubernetes/OpenShift cluster operations ([setup guide](../../README.md))

**Required MCP Tools** (all from `openshift-administration` server):
- `pods_list` — list pods in a namespace with status and labels
- `resources_list` — list resources by apiVersion/kind in a namespace
- `resources_get` — get a single resource by apiVersion/kind/name
- `resources_create_or_update` — apply NetworkPolicy YAML (for temporary verification)
- `resources_delete` — remove dry-run NetworkPolicies

**Environment Variables:**
- `KUBECONFIG` — path to kubeconfig with access to the target cluster

**Verification Steps:**
1. Check `openshift-administration` MCP server is available
2. Verify `KUBECONFIG` is set: `test -n "$KUBECONFIG" && echo "✓ Set" || echo "✗ Missing"`
3. Verify cluster access by listing namespaces via `namespaces_list`
4. If any check fails → Human Notification Protocol

**Human Notification Protocol:**

When prerequisites fail:
1. **Stop immediately** — No tool calls
2. **Report error:**
   ```
   ❌ Cannot execute skill: MCP server `openshift-administration` unavailable
   📋 Setup: Configure the openshift MCP server in mcps.json with KUBECONFIG
   ```
3. **Request decision:** "How to proceed? (setup/skip/abort)"
4. **Wait for user input**

**Security:** Never display credential values. Only report whether KUBECONFIG is set.

## When to Use This Skill

Use when:
- Creating NetworkPolicies for a Kubernetes/OpenShift namespace
- Auditing existing network isolation for a workload
- Designing network segmentation for a new application deployment
- Verifying that NetworkPolicies correctly implement Zero Trust principles
- Implementing default-deny with per-pod allow rules

Do NOT use when:
- Configuring Admin Network Policies (ANPs) — those are cluster-admin infrastructure guardrails
- Configuring CNI plugins, Multus, or SR-IOV — use cluster-level networking skills
- Troubleshooting pod connectivity without existing policies — diagnose first, then design
- Managing firewall rules outside the cluster — this skill covers Kubernetes NetworkPolicy API only

## Workflow

This skill operates in **two mandatory tiers**. Both must be completed before producing the final implementation plan.

---

### Tier 1: Architecture Analysis (Offline)

**Objective:** Understand the application's communication requirements from source code, documentation, and deployment manifests — before touching a live cluster.

### Step 1: Identify All Pod Types

For each pod type in the namespace, document:
- Pod name pattern and label selectors
- Container names and exposed ports (containerPort)
- Whether it uses `hostNetwork` (critical — NetworkPolicies do NOT apply to hostNetwork pods)
- Whether it uses `hostPID` or `hostIPC`
- Service account and RBAC bindings (indicates K8s API access needs)
- Volume mounts — especially hostPath, CSI, and projected volumes

### Step 2: Identify All Services

For each service:
- Service name, type (ClusterIP/NodePort/LoadBalancer), ports
- Which pods are targeted (selector)
- Which routes expose the service externally

### Step 3: Map Communication Flows

For each pod type, determine:
- **Ingress:** Who connects TO this pod? From which namespace? On which port? Via service or direct?
- **Egress:** Where does this pod connect? DNS? K8s API? Other pods? External services? Other namespaces?
- **Protocol:** TCP or UDP? gRPC? HTTP/HTTPS? Unix socket (not network — no NP needed)?

### Step 4: Check for Operator-Managed NetworkPolicies

Some operators create and manage their own NetworkPolicies (e.g., RHBK operator creates `keycloak-network-policy`). These must NOT be duplicated or overridden — the operator will revert changes. Document them and design around them.

### Step 5: Identify Special Networking Cases

- **hostNetwork pods** — exempt from NetworkPolicies. Document as known exception.
- **Host-network source IPs** — pods connecting FROM hostNetwork (e.g., OCP router, spire-agent) use node IPs. `podSelector`/`namespaceSelector` cannot match them. Use port-only rules.
- **K8s API server** — endpoints are node IPs after DNAT. Port-only rules on 6443 (or 443 for ClusterIP service) are required.
- **OCP router** — uses `policy-group.network.openshift.io/ingress` namespace label for ingress matching.
- **DNS** — OCP uses CoreDNS on port 5353 (not 53). Target namespace: `openshift-dns`.

### Step 6: Draft Initial Rules

For each pod type, propose:
- Ingress rules with justification
- Egress rules with justification
- Ports, protocols, selectors, and namespace selectors

**Tier 1 output:** Present the communication map and draft rules to the user. Get confirmation before proceeding to Tier 2.

---

### Tier 2: Live Cluster Verification

**Objective:** Validate the draft rules against a running cluster. Confirm actual pod labels, ports, connections, and behavior.

**Prerequisites:** User must have an OCP/Kubernetes cluster with the target application deployed and healthy. The `openshift-administration` MCP server must be connected.

### Step 7: Verify Pod Inventory

**MCP Tool:** `pods_list` (from openshift-administration)

**Parameters:**
- `namespace`: "<namespace>" (string, target namespace to verify)

**Expected Output:** List of pods with name, status, and ready state.

**Error Handling:**
- If MCP server unavailable: → Human Notification Protocol
- If namespace not found: ask user to verify namespace name

### Step 8: Verify Pod Labels

**MCP Tool:** `resources_list` (from openshift-administration)

**Parameters:**
- `apiVersion`: "v1" (string)
- `kind`: "Pod" (string)
- `namespace`: "<namespace>" (string)

**Expected Output:** Full pod specs including `metadata.labels`. Confirm labels match the selectors drafted in Tier 1.

**Error Handling:**
- If labels differ from Tier 1 analysis: update draft rules to match actual labels

### Step 9: Verify Services and Endpoints

**MCP Tool:** `resources_list` (from openshift-administration)

**Parameters (Services):**
- `apiVersion`: "v1"
- `kind`: "Service"
- `namespace`: "<namespace>"

**Parameters (Endpoints):**
- `apiVersion`: "v1"
- `kind`: "Endpoints"
- `namespace`: "<namespace>"

**Expected Output:** Services with ports, selectors, and endpoint addresses.

**Error Handling:**
- If endpoints are empty: the service has no healthy backends — investigate before applying policies

### Step 10: Verify Routes

**MCP Tool:** `resources_list` (from openshift-administration)

**Parameters:**
- `apiVersion`: "route.openshift.io/v1"
- `kind`: "Route"
- `namespace`: "<namespace>"

**Expected Output:** Routes with host, TLS termination, and target service.

**Error Handling:**
- If no routes found and ingress expected: verify the application is exposed correctly

### Step 11: Verify Existing NetworkPolicies

**MCP Tool:** `resources_list` (from openshift-administration)

**Parameters:**
- `apiVersion`: "networking.k8s.io/v1"
- `kind`: "NetworkPolicy"
- `namespace`: "<namespace>"

**Expected Output:** Existing policies including operator-managed ones. Cross-reference with Tier 1 Step 4 findings.

**Error Handling:**
- If operator-managed policies found: document them, do not duplicate

### Step 12: Verify Container Ports and hostNetwork

**MCP Tool:** `resources_list` (from openshift-administration)

**Parameters (Deployments):**
- `apiVersion`: "apps/v1"
- `kind`: "Deployment"
- `namespace`: "<namespace>"

Repeat for `kind`: "StatefulSet" and `kind`: "DaemonSet".

**Expected Output:** Workload specs including `spec.template.spec.containers[].ports` and `spec.template.spec.hostNetwork`.

**Error Handling:**
- If hostNetwork=true: flag as NetworkPolicy exception — policies do not apply to these pods

### Step 13: Review Component Logs

**MCP Tool:** `pods_log` (from openshift-administration)

**Parameters:**
- `namespace`: "<namespace>"
- `name`: "<pod-name>" (string, specific pod name)
- `tail`: 100 (integer, recent lines)

For each pod type, check logs for:
- Successful connections (confirms required flows)
- Connection sources (IP addresses, namespaces)
- Error patterns (may reveal additional required flows)

**Error Handling:**
- If pod has multiple containers: check logs for each container

### Step 14: Temporary Apply-and-Verify

**Human Confirmation Required** — display all policies and wait for approval before applying.

**MCP Tool:** `resources_create_or_update` (from openshift-administration)

**Parameters:**
- `resource`: "<full-networkpolicy-yaml>" (string, complete NetworkPolicy manifest)

Apply each proposed NetworkPolicy. Then verify:
- All pods remain Running and Ready (use `pods_list`)
- All routes respond (check via route host)
- All dependent applications in other namespaces still work
- Logs show no new connection errors (use `pods_log`)
- **Human Confirmation Required** before force-restarting critical pods — list pods to restart, ask for approval, then verify recovery

### Step 15: Record Verification Results

For each verification check, record PASS or FAIL with evidence.

**If any check FAILS:** Immediately proceed to Step 16 to remove the applied policies before diagnosing the issue. Report the failure evidence to the user and ask how to proceed (fix draft rules and retry, or abort).

### Step 16: Clean Up Verification Policies

**Human Confirmation Required** — list policies and wait for approval.

**MCP Tool:** `resources_delete` (from openshift-administration)

**Parameters:**
- `apiVersion`: "networking.k8s.io/v1"
- `kind`: "NetworkPolicy"
- `name`: "<policy-name>" (string)
- `namespace`: "<namespace>" (string)

**Error Handling:**
- If delete fails: report the error and ask user for manual intervention

---

### Implementation Plan

After both tiers are complete, produce the final implementation plan.

**The plan MUST include:**

#### 1. Executive Summary
- Namespace secured
- Number of pod types covered
- Number of NetworkPolicies proposed
- Known exceptions (hostNetwork pods, operator-managed policies)

#### 2. Default-Deny Decision

**A default-deny NetworkPolicy MUST be included in every implementation plan.**

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: default-deny-in-namespace-<namespace>
spec:
  podSelector: {}
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
  - Egress
```

If the user decides NOT to implement default-deny, this must be:
- Explicitly documented as a **security exception**
- Justified with a written reason
- Acknowledged by the user as a **deviation from NIST SP 800-207**
- Flagged as: *"Without default-deny, any pod not matching an existing policy has UNRESTRICTED network access — full DNS, cross-namespace, and internet egress."*

#### 3. Per-Pod Policy Rules

For each pod type, document:

| Field | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Pod type** | Name, labels, workload type |
| **Policy name** | Kubernetes NetworkPolicy name |
| **Ingress rules** | Each rule with: port, protocol, source (selector or port-only), **justification** |
| **Egress rules** | Each rule with: port, protocol, destination (selector or port-only), **justification** |
| **Why this rule exists** | Reference to the communication flow identified in Tier 1 |
| **What breaks if removed** | Specific failure mode |

#### 4. Known Exceptions

Document each exception:
- hostNetwork pods — which pods, why, what it means for network isolation
- Operator-managed policies — which operator, which policy, what it covers
- Port-only rules (no selector) — which rules, why selectors can't be used
- Any pod type intentionally left without a policy — justify

#### 5. Verification Results

| Verification | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| All pods Running after NP applied | PASS/FAIL | `pods_list` output |
| Routes respond | PASS/FAIL | HTTP status codes |
| Dependent apps work | PASS/FAIL | Specific checks performed |
| Pod restart recovery | PASS/FAIL | Logs showing re-attestation/reconnection |
| No new errors in logs | PASS/FAIL | Log excerpts |

#### 6. Implementation Approach

Recommend the deployment method:
- **Externalized chart** — if the app uses a Helm chart, add NP templates to the chart with values-based configuration (default disabled). Users enable via `extraValueFiles` in their pattern.
- **Direct manifests** — if the app doesn't use a chart or for pattern-specific policies.
- **Operator-managed** — if an operator should own the policies (rare, for operators you control).

#### 7. NIST SP 800-207 Alignment

Map each policy to Zero Trust principles:
- **Least privilege** — only explicitly required connections are allowed
- **Assume breach** — default-deny limits blast radius of a compromised pod
- **Microsegmentation** — per-pod policies, not per-namespace
- **No implicit trust** — cross-namespace and internet access explicitly denied unless justified

### Strict Rules

1. **Never skip Tier 2.** Architecture analysis alone is insufficient — live verification catches configuration drift, operator-added resources, and undocumented connections.
2. **Never skip default-deny.** If the user doesn't want it, document it as a security exception — don't silently omit it.
3. **Justify every open port.** "It might be needed" is not a justification. Every ingress and egress rule must trace back to an observed communication flow.
4. **Document every exception.** hostNetwork, port-only rules, operator-managed policies — all must be explicitly called out with explanations.
5. **Test before recommending.** The temporary apply-and-verify phase is mandatory. Untested policies are proposals, not recommendations.
6. **OVN-Kubernetes awareness.** On OpenShift, understand OVN-K-specific behaviors: policy-group labels for router ingress, port 5353 for DNS (not 53), DNAT for K8s API, transit IPs for hostNetwork pods.
7. **Helm template conditions.** When creating NetworkPolicy templates gated by values (e.g., `enabled: true`), always use `(eq (.Values.field | toString) "true")` — not bare `.Values.field`. Helm overrides via `extraValueFiles` and pattern frameworks often pass booleans as strings (`"true"` not `true`). Bare boolean evaluation fails silently when the value is a string, causing policies to not render. Apply `| toString` consistently to ALL condition halves in `{{- if and ... }}` expressions.
8. **MCP tools first.** Always use MCP tools from `openshift-administration` for cluster operations. Do not use `oc` or `kubectl` CLI commands unless no MCP alternative exists.

## Human-in-the-Loop

This skill performs operations that modify cluster state, requiring explicit user confirmation:

1. **Before applying NetworkPolicies** (Step 14)
   - Display the full YAML of each policy to be applied
   - Show which namespace will be affected
   - Ask: "Should I apply these policies for verification?"
   - Wait for explicit confirmation (yes/no)

2. **Before force-restarting pods** (Step 14)
   - List pods to be restarted
   - Ask: "Should I restart these pods to verify recovery?"
   - Wait for confirmation

3. **Before removing verification policies** (Step 16)
   - List all policies to be removed
   - Ask: "Should I remove the verification policies?"
   - Wait for confirmation

4. **Default-deny exception**
   - If the user decides NOT to implement default-deny, require explicit written acknowledgment
   - Display: *"Without default-deny, any pod not matching an existing policy has UNRESTRICTED network access — full DNS, cross-namespace, and internet egress."*
   - Ask: "Do you acknowledge this deviation from NIST SP 800-207?"

**Never assume approval** — always wait for explicit confirmation before apply, delete, or restart operations.

## Example Usage

**User:** "Create NetworkPolicies for the qtodo namespace following Zero Trust principles"

**Skill response:**
1. Tier 1: Analyzes qtodo source code and Helm chart, identifies pods (qtodo-app, qtodo-db), services (qtodo, qtodo-db), routes, and communication flows (ingress from router, egress to DB/DNS/Keycloak/Vault).
2. Presents communication map and draft rules for user review.
3. Tier 2: Connects to the cluster via MCP, verifies pod labels, services, and existing policies. Temporarily applies draft policies, verifies all pods healthy, routes respond, and logs show no errors, then removes verification policies.
4. Produces the final implementation plan with default-deny, per-pod rules, exceptions, verification results, and NIST alignment.
